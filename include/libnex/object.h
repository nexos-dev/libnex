 * @file object.h
 * So, just what is an object? An object is the abstraction which most classes
 * in libnex (and hopefully users) work with. Basically, an object is anything.
 * The idea is that a structure includes a type Object_t as its first member.
 * Users or the implementation then use the object functions on this struct to
 * allow for reference counting, comparison, and other useful things. See source
 * or header for more info

 * Object_t is a type that defines an object. An object is designed to be used
 * for conviencince by allowing for comparison, type comparison, and other
 * useful things for divergent types. It also can be used to promote memory
 * safety by reference counting. To use Object_t in your own types, ensure it is
 * the first thing in the structure. That way, users can you types coequally as
 * Object_t and whatever its native form it as well.
